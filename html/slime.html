                Plot
            </h3>
                <p>
                    Satoru Mikami is an ordinary 42-year-old corporate worker living in Tokyo. He is almost content with his monotonous life,
                     despite the fact that he does not have a girlfriend. During a casual encounter with his colleague, an assailant tries to stab his friend, 
                     and Satoru pushes his friend out of the way and gets stabbed instead. While succumbing to his injuries, a mysterious voice echoes in his mind and asks a series ofquestions. 
                    In response to Satoru's answers the voice grants him various gifts, and powers to use in his next life. 
                </p> 

                <p>
                    After regaining consciousness, Satoru discovers that he has been reincarnated as a Slime in an unfamiliar fantasy world called the Central World. At the same time, he also acquire new-found skills, particularly the ability called "Predator," which allows him to devour anything and mimic its appearance and skills. He stumbles upon Veldora, a powerful 'Storm Dragon', who has been sealed for the last 300 years for reducing a town to ashes. Feeling sorry for him, Satoru befriends the dragon, promising to help him in destroying the seal. He decides to exchange names, Veldora bestows upon him the name Rimuru, and he receives the name Tempest in return.
                    Rimuru then consumes the dragon together with his prison in order to analyze the spell and eventually free Veldora. During his journey, he gains a human form after devouring a deceased human named Shizue Izawa.
